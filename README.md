### SQLMap
SQLMap is an open-source tool primarily used to test the security of web applications that have vulnerabilities related to SQL injection. The main purpose of SQLMap is to automate the process of detecting and exploiting security flaws in databases through SQL injection.

When executing SQLMap, you provide a URL or a file containing a suspicious payload, and the tool performs a series of tests to determine if the web application is vulnerable to SQL injection. SQLMap attempts to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities to extract sensitive information from the database, such as table names, columns, records, and even user credentials.

The tool offers various options and advanced features, allowing you to customize the tests according to your needs. It supports various types of databases, including MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, among others.
